# PixiJS space shooter

This project was developed as a learning experience, to learn the basics of video game development using PixiJS as the graphics engine, all within a React app in Typescript.

## Running the game

You can start the game by running the following two commands in two shells:

- `npx tsc -w` to compile the TS code to JS
- `npm start` to run the React app

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
